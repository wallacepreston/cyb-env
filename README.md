## Current Status
(What's working and what's not)

### Limitations
- Workspaces: IDX has a limit of 1 workspace per user. The students will get an error if trying to click the link to create a second environment, so we need to inform them to continue using the same environment for all units.
- GUI: Some labs and projects require a GUI (see below), and a GUI is not available in the current environment. We need to provide alternative instructions for these labs and projects.
  - 🔵 = No env necessary
  - 🟢 = Working
  - 🟡 = Limited functionality (works, but not exactly as currently in the coursework)
  - 🔴 = Not currently working

  - 🟢 Lab: Working (ls, cd, pwd, mv, tree, cowsay, apt install)
  - 🟡 Project: Limited - git, ssh (can't ssh from externally, but can from within IDX)
